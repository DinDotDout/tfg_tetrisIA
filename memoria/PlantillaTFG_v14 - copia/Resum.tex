\chapter{Project summary}

The basis of this project consists in achieving an \ac{AI} capable of playing the game “Tetris 99” in the console known as “Switch”, manufactured by the famous game company Nintendo. The task may seem simple at the beginning, but the sole nature of having to intercommunicate two devices (PC and console), with non-existent tools comercially available, already shows us that this will not be a trivial matter. The AI has to be built and trained through a custom PC environment, and then be able to receive and send information to the console reliably.
